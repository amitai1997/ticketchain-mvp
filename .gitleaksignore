# GitLeaks ignore patterns for false positives
# Add patterns here if GitLeaks flags legitimate code as secrets

# Example patterns:
# false-positive-pattern
# test-data-that-looks-like-secrets

# Common false positives in blockchain/crypto projects:
# Contract addresses (these are public)
0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}

# Test private keys (these are for testing only)
# test/fixtures/**
# *.test.*

# Documentation examples
# docs/**/*.md

# Environment example files
.env.example
*.env.example

# Package lock files may contain hashes that look like secrets
package-lock.json
yarn.lock
poetry.lock
