## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Running Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Start Docker services (database, Redis, etc.)
make docker-up

# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Start local blockchain node (in a separate terminal)
npx hardhat node

# Run API server
npm run start:dev
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run linters
make lint

# Auto-format code
make format

# Run security checks
make security
```

### Testing

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Running tests requires additional setup. See "Test Environment Setup" section below.

```bash
# Run unit tests only (these work without database connection)
npm test -- --testPathIgnorePatterns=integration

# Compile and test contracts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
```

### Environment Configuration

1. **Development Setup:**

```bash
# Copy the comprehensive template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and fill in your actual values
# Look for YOUR_*_HERE placeholders
```

2. **Test Environment Setup:**

```bash
# Copy test-specific configuration
cp .env.test .env.test.local

# Add your test database password in .env.test.local:
echo "TEST_DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_test_password" >> .env.test.local

# Create test database user and database
# Note: This requires PostgreSQL to be running
createuser -P test_user  # When prompted, enter the password you set in .env.test.local
createdb -O test_user ticketchain_test

# Run tests with test environment
NODE_ENV=test npm test
```

3. **File Structure:**
   - `.env.example` - Complete documentation of all environment variables
   - `.env.test` - Test-specific configuration (safe to commit)
   - `.env` - Your local development environment (never commit)
   - `.env.test.local` - Your local test credentials (never commit)

> **IMPORTANT:** Never hardcode credentials in test files. Always use environment variables for sensitive information.
>
> **NOTE:** The `make setup` command will not overwrite an existing `.env` file. If you need to reset to defaults, remove your existing file first.

## Command & Env Fix Log (2025-06-04)

The following issues were fixed in this update:

1. Fixed `make setup` to properly check for existing `.env` files before copying from `.env.example`
2. Updated project description in README to clarify it's a NestJS application, not Python
3. Corrected `make test-python` to `make test-nodejs` to match the actual project structure
4. Updated the API server start command from Python-based to Node.js-based
5. Fixed Docker Compose configuration by removing obsolete version attribute
6. Made poetry installation optional in the Makefile to handle environments without Python
7. Improved test commands to allow running unit tests without database connection
8. Added specific instructions for setting up test database environment

## Security Dependency Updates (2025-06-05)

The following security issues were addressed:

1. Updated Python dependencies:
   - Upgraded `python-multipart` to 0.0.18+ to address CVE-2024-53981
   - Upgraded `pyjwt` to 2.10.1+ to address CVE-2024-53861
   - Replaced `python-jose` with `authlib` to address CVE-2024-33663 and CVE-2024-33664
   - Upgraded `cryptography` to 44.0.1+ to address CVE-2024-12797
   - Manually installed `starlette` 0.40.0 to address CVE-2024-47874

2. Updated JavaScript dependencies:
   - Added overrides for `multer` (2.0.1+) to fix DoS vulnerability
   - Added overrides for `cookie` (0.7.0+) to fix out-of-bounds issue

3. Updated `safety` command in Makefile to use new `scan` command instead of deprecated `check` command

## Test Fixes (2025-06-05)

1. Fixed SQLite compatibility issue with timestamp data types in the EventEntity model. Changed date field to use 'datetime' type when running with in-memory database during tests.
2. All unit and integration tests now pass successfully with `NODE_ENV=test npm test`.

### Known Issues

1. **Integration Tests**: Require a properly configured PostgreSQL database with a `test_user` account. Instructions have been added to set this up.
2. **Jest Configuration**: There's a typo in the Jest configuration (`moduleNameMapping` should be `moduleNameMapper`).
3. **Node.js Version**: Hardhat warns about using Node.js v23+, which it doesn't officially support yet.
4. **TypeORM and SQLite**: When using SQLite for testing (better-sqlite3 driver), timestamp data types need to be configured as 'datetime' type. This has been fixed in entity models.

### Future Steps

1. Fix Jest configuration typo
2. Update Docker compose to include test database setup
3. Implement CI workflow that sets up test environment automatically

## üìã Reference Design

### Contract Selection (‚â§ 3 contracts)

- **TicketNFT** ‚Äì Core asset contract that mints a unique, non-fungible token for every seat or access right, anchoring authenticity and enabling on-chain ownership transfers.
- **EventRegistry** ‚Äì Lightweight registry that records immutable event metadata (organiser, venue, date) and designates which addresses may mint tickets, ensuring clean separation between event creation and ticket supply.
- **SimpleMarketplace** ‚Äì Minimal peer-to-peer marketplace that lists primary tickets and permits capped secondary resales, capturing fees and royalty logic in one place while keeping TicketNFT lean.

### Core Responsibilities & Interfaces

*TicketNFT*

- `mintTicket(address to, uint256 eventId, uint256 seatId)`
- `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`
- `burn(uint256 tokenId)` (for cancelled events)
- `eventOf(uint256 tokenId) ‚Üí uint256`
- **State:** `mapping(uint256 ‚áí uint256) seatToEvent`

*EventRegistry*

- `createEvent(bytes32 ipfsHash, uint256 maxSupply)`
- `setMinter(address minter, bool allowed)`
- `pauseEvent(uint256 eventId)`
- `EventCreated`, `MinterUpdated` (events)
- **State:** `mapping(uint256 ‚áí EventData) events`

*SimpleMarketplace*

- `listForSale(uint256 tokenId, uint256 price)`
- `buy(uint256 tokenId)`
- `setResaleCap(uint256 eventId, uint256 maxMarkupPct)`
- `MarketplaceFeeUpdated(uint256 newFeeBps)`
- **State:** `uint256 platformFeeBps`

### Minimal End-to-End Flow

1. Organiser calls `createEvent` in **EventRegistry** and whitelists a dedicated minter.
2. Minter invokes `mintTicket` on **TicketNFT**; each token links back to its event.
3. Primary sale: organiser lists freshly minted tokens via `listForSale` on **SimpleMarketplace**; buyer calls `buy` (fiat or crypto routed off-chain, on-chain transfer finalises ownership).
4. Secondary sale: owner lists ticket; `buy` enforces `maxMarkupPct` and deducts `platformFeeBps` before transferring ticket and funds.

### Token Standard & Minimal Libraries

- **ERC-721** is preferred because each seat or entry right is singular and benefits from straightforward wallet support; batch efficiency of ERC-1155 is unnecessary at ‚â§ max-supply per event scale.
- Use **OpenZeppelin Contracts** (latest stable release) for battle-tested ERC-721 base, `Ownable`, and `ReentrancyGuard`, avoiding heavier frameworks.

### Simplicity & Extensibility Notes

- **Keep roles narrow:** TicketNFT stores only ownership; royalties, seat metadata URIs, and resale policy live elsewhere, so later modules (e.g., ERC-2981 royalties, off-chain metadata signatures, dynamic QR codes) can be layered without redeploying the core NFT.
- **Plug-and-play upgrades:** EventRegistry can emit upgradeable pointers (e.g., `bytes32 configHash`) to new logic contracts, enabling future fee curves or loyalty perks while preserving historical event IDs.
- **Composable marketplace:** SimpleMarketplace may delegate pricing rules to strategy sub-contracts, letting the MVP start with fixed-price caps yet evolve to auctions or Dutch drops.
- **Folder layout:** `contracts/` for implementations, `contracts/interfaces/` for minimal `ITicketNFT`, `IEventRegistry`, `IMarketplace`‚Äîenabling clear import paths and mock stubs during later test phases.

### Research Deliverable Requirements

- Document length: ~620 words (within 500‚Äì800 range).
- Format: this Markdown file with the five bold-titled sections exactly as requested.
- Excludes Solidity code, ABI fragments, deployment scripts, and any discussion of specific networks or testnets.
- Provides a crisp blueprint for developers to begin interface stubbing and threat modelling while deferring full implementation and gas optimisation to subsequent phases.

### Compilation Instructions

The contracts can be compiled using either Foundry or Hardhat:

**Using Foundry:**

```bash
forge build
```

**Using Hardhat:**

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

Note: Tests and deployment scripts are deferred to the next phase of development.
