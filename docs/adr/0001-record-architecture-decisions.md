# ADR-0001: Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2025-05-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project to:

- Maintain project memory across team changes
- Understand the rationale behind past decisions
- Provide context for future modifications
- Enable informed decision-making

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), as described by Michael Nygard, to document all significant architectural decisions.

Each ADR will:

- Be numbered sequentially (ADR-NNNN)
- Be stored in `docs/adr/`
- Follow the MADR (Markdown Architecture Decision Records) format
- Include: Title, Date, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences
- Be immutable once accepted (superseded by new ADRs if needed)

## Consequences

### Positive

- Creates a decision log for the project
- Helps onboard new team members
- Documents the "why" behind architectural choices
- Supports thoughtful, deliberate architecture evolution

### Negative

- Requires discipline to maintain
- Adds a small overhead to decision-making process
- May become outdated if not properly superseded

### Neutral

- Becomes part of the standard development workflow
- Requires team agreement on what constitutes an "architectural decision"

## Template

```markdown
