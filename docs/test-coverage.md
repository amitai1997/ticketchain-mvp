# TicketChain MVP Test Coverage Documentation

## Overview

This document details the current test coverage for the TicketChain MVP project as of P-0 completion. The test suite has been streamlined to focus on the core functionality that is currently implemented in the smart contracts, with placeholders for future features.

## Current Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

#### EventRegistry.test.js
- **Deployment**: Owner verification, initial state validation
- **Event Creation**: Parameter validation, event emission, counter incrementation
- **Access Control**: Minter authorization, permission checks
- **Event Management**: Pause functionality, state validation
- **View Functions**: Event details retrieval, minter status checks
- **Error Handling**: Invalid IPFS hash, zero supply, non-existent events

#### TicketNFT.test.js
- **Deployment**: Name, symbol, and registry address verification
- **Minting**: Metadata validation, event emission, ownership verification
- **Authorization**: Minter permission checks, event pause enforcement
- **Seat Management**: Duplicate seat prevention, cross-event seat validation
- **Standard ERC-721**: Interface support, approve, transfer functionality
- **Event/Seat Associations**: Event and seat ID mapping to tokens

#### SimpleMarketplace.test.js
- **Deployment**: Owner, platform fee, contract address verifications
- *Note: Limited to basic deployment checks as marketplace functionality will be expanded in future phases*

### Integration Tests

#### FullFlow.test.js
- **Access Control Integration**: Cross-contract minter authorization
- **Event Pause Enforcement**: Blocked minting for paused events

#### EdgeCases.test.js
- **Overflow/Underflow Protection**: MaxUint256 values, zero values
- **Invalid Input Handling**: Zero hash, zero supply rejection

### Gas Optimization Tests

#### GasOptimization.test.js
- **Event Creation Gas**: Measurement and threshold validation
- **Ticket Minting Gas**: Measurement and threshold validation

## Removed/Postponed Tests

The following tests have been removed or postponed as they target functionality not yet implemented in the current P-0 contracts:

### Marketplace Functionality
- Full ticket lifecycle (mint → list → buy)
- Royalty distribution
- Price cap enforcement
- Listing management

### Advanced Security Features
- Re-entrancy protection
- Race condition handling

### Extended Features
- Batch operations
- Metadata URI handling
- Advanced ticket ownership queries

## Test Fixtures

The fixtures are designed to support both current and future tests:

- **deployFixture**: Deploys all contracts with proper constructor arguments
- **createEvent**: Creates test events with proper parameter handling
- **mintTickets**: Mints tickets with authorization handling and event log parsing

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Marketplace Implementation**: As the SimpleMarketplace contract is expanded to support listing and purchasing tickets, corresponding tests will be implemented or un-skipped.

2. **Security Enhancement**: Implement and test re-entrancy protection for the marketplace functionality.

3. **Advanced Features**: Implement batch operations, metadata enhancements, and related tests.

4. **Test Expansion**: Add more test cases for edge conditions and boundary values as the contracts mature.

This document will be updated as new features are implemented and test coverage expands in subsequent development phases.
